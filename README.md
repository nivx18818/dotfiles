# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and editor configuration. It's intended to be a reference and a drop-in configuration for a fast, ergonomic Neovim development setup and a few other tools.

## Prerequisites

- Allow the execution of PowerShell scripts if you haven't already done so:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

- Restart your PowerShell session to apply the changes.
